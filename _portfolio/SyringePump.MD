### Purpose and Features
The syringe pump project aims to deliver fluids at controlled flow rates for applications such as healthcare, microfluidics, and industrial use. It offers a cost-effective, customizable alternative to traditional syringe pumps by utilizing 3D printing and Arduino programming. Key features include:
- Adjustable flow rates (1â€“10 mL/min) using a potentiometer.
- Compatibility with syringes of varying diameters (10 mL to 20 mL).
- LED indicators for operation states (running, paused, or empty).
- Manual adjustments using momentary buttons for precision control.

### Operating Instructions
1. **Assembly**: Mount the stepper motor, lead screw, and syringe holder. Secure all components.
2. **Install the Syringe**: Fill the syringe with the desired fluid, remove air bubbles, and insert it into the holder.
3. **Connect to Power**: Connect the system to a 12V power supply.
4. **Upload Code**: Use the Arduino IDE to upload the control code to the microcontroller.
5. **Start Operation**: Adjust the flow rate using the potentiometer and press the start button.
6. **Monitor Operation**: Observe LED indicators to track the state (green for running, yellow for paused, red for empty).
7. **Shutdown**: Turn off the power supply and clean the syringe after use.
